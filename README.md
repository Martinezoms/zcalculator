# Zcalculator
A simple web application calculator with history and dark mode features

# About
  Zcalculator is just like any other simple calculator, but with a little bit of additional features. It carries out calculations using the mathjs library. It also has the feature of storing previous calculations and can be accessed on the 'history' drawer. You can also choose a prefered colour mode (that is light and adrk modes).
  
# Why Zcalculator
  The process of building this web application helped me to practise and get more familiar with react-hooks and also how to use the local storage. It also allowed me to experience how aiding it is to use libraries in your development, which is amazing, time saving and productive. And yes, I also got to understand how to build themes for your applications in a more productive and efficient way. So this web application counts as a process or means of acquiring knowledge and implementing them to achieve results.
  
# Functionality
  Zcalculator is made up of pretty simple components: the calculator box which is made up of the display screen and the buttons, a float button by the right-bottom where you can access other features, and a history drawer.
  The display screen is made up of the input section and the output section. The float button consist of the history, dark mode and rotate(coming soon) buttons/icons which when clicked, carries out the functions.
